# Research

Welcome to my research page. Here, I share information about my current projects and research interests.

## Geometric Deep Learning
My primary research focus is on Geometric Deep Learning and its applications in Biomedical AI. I explore how machine learning on non-Euclidean domains, such as graphs, hypergraphs, and manifolds, can enhance our understanding and prediction capabilities in complex biomedical systems.

## Biomedical AI
I am particularly interested in applications within Biomedical AI, including modeling molecular structures for drug discovery, analyzing patient networks for personalized medicine, and predicting interactions within biological systems.

## Previous Work
My previous research at Oxford included work on Stochastic Analysis and the application of geometric and network science principles to model dynamic systems.
