# About me

Hi! I’m a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at Harvard University, advised by Marinka Zitnik and Sham Kakade. My work is supported by a Graduate Research fellowship from Harvard's [Kempner Institute for Natural and Artificial Intelligence](https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/).

I work with the Artificial Intelligence for Medicine and Science lab at Harvard Medical School and the Foundations of Machine Learning group at SEAS, where my research revolves around the mathematical principles of large learning systems and the development of autonomous agents that can reliably reason and plan. I’m especially interested in bridging rigorous theory with real-world applications in biology and healthcare.

Previously, I earned a Master’s in Mathematics (Distinction) from Trinity College, University of Oxford, focusing on probability, stochastic analysis, and geometry, and a Master’s in Computer Science from Harvard, focusing on high-performance computing and large-scale data systems.
		
I’m always happy to connect—feel free to reach out here or via email/X.
